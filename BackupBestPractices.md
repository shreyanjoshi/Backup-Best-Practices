# Backup best practices with pros and cons.

To keep your Bitcoin safe, you only need to secure your mnemonic and keep it private.

The most crucial step in securing your Bitcoin is to create backups of your mnemonic. This will protect you from potential loss, damage, theft, or disasters that may affect the security of your mobile, desktop, or hardware wallet that stores your mnemonic.

When backing up your mnemonic, you should strike a balance between creating multiple backups to avoid having a single point of failure, and ensuring that all backup locations are secure, private, and not susceptible to loss, seizure, restricted access, or theft.

It's essential to keep in mind that if any one of your backups is compromised, your funds can be stolen. Therefore, if you suspect that any of your backups have been compromised, you should transfer all your funds to a new wallet with a new mnemonic as soon as possible.

Below listed are the best practices to follow in creating backups of your mnemonic with pros and cons:

1. Different ways to store your mnemonic.
a) Paper or Metal: Writing down your mnemonic on a piece of paper or etching it onto a metal surface are two of the most popular ways to store it offline. The choice to select one between the two must be made depending on the balance in your desired level of security, and ease-of-use andaccessibility. Here is a list of points to consider while making the decision:
• Security: Paper is more vulnerable to damage, theft, or loss, and can easily be destroyed by water, fire, or other environmental factors, compared to metal which is a sturdy and resilient material that can withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a good option for long-term storage.
• Ease-of-use and accesibility: Paper is an extremely simple way to store your mnemonic which is a good starting point for people new to self-custody because it is easy to write on, carry around if someone has to move geographically frequently, and has zero cost. Metal can induce process fatigue for someone new to self-custody, is costlier to buy and engrave words on, and and is bulkier to move around with, affecting accessibility. 
• Privacy concerns: Your mnemonic should ideally be kept somewhere private and accessible only by you, but using a metal plate like the CoinKite SeedPlate to engrave your mnemonic gives you an added layer of privacy from onlookers and buys you time, compared to paper which a sophisticated attacker might only need one glance to steal it. 
b) Encrypting the mnemonic: Encryption is a technique to encode/hide any message(your mnemonic in this case) which can only be decoded by a secret password. Encrypting your mnemonic with a strong password can add an extra layer of security against unauthorized access and allow you to make and upload multiple encrypted copies to the internet, but if you lose the password, you will not be able to recover your funds. Encrypting the mnemonic currently does not have a standardized workflow in any of the standard wallets and should be done only by someone with the technical proficiency to manage it.
c) Using a cypher: Using a code or cypher to obfuscate your mnemonic can add an additional layer of security, e.g., highlighting the words in your favourite books and noting down only the page numbers, but it can also be difficult to remember the code or decode the mnemonic when you need it so this technique should be pursued only if you feel comfortable with it or that it is necessary given your life situatuon. 

2. Multiple backups/ Removing single point of failure:
a) Geographically distributed locations: Storing backups in multiple physical locations, such as different homes or bank vaults can protect against loss due to natural disasters or damage, because you can afford to lose one of the backups, but it can also make it harder to protect yourself against theft because you have to secure multiple locations. Try to find a balance between the two you feel comfortable with.
b) SeedXOR: Using a technique called SeedXOR to use two(or more) mnemonics and doing XOR
